# TBG Forums Random Post Button (Formerly: RandomPostButton)
A Script for TamperMonkey that adds a button to https://tbgforums.com/forums/index.php and brings you to a random post when clicked

Add the script to tampermonkey and a button labeled "Random Post" will appear on the home page of https://tbgforums.com/

The button is intended to be used side by side with my Random Topic Button: https://github.com/PhantomLuigi/TBG-Forums-Random-Topic-Button/tree/main

Each theme is set to no zoom in or out for the website, if you are zoomed in or out, it will be off pixel, don't think that really concerns anyone except me though
